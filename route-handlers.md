## Route Handlers

- We can also create custom request handlers for our routes using a feature called route handlers
- Unlike page routes, which respond with HTML content, route handlers allow you to create RESTful endpoints, giving you full control over the response
- There is no overhead of having to create and configure a separate server
- Route handlers run server-side, ensuring that sensitive information like private keys remains secure ans never gets shipped to the browser
- Route handlers are the equivalent of API routes in Page Router
